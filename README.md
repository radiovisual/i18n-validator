# i18n-validator

> Fast, configurable and extendable CLI to look for common problems in your translated source files.

## Why?

> Have you ever shipped "buggy" translation files to your users in proudction? Probably. I know I have!

Translated files in your software project are an often-overlooked source of problems that can affect the usability and reliability of your applications. These translated files are often edited manually, built automatically (without any integrity checks) or outsourced to a third party to provide translations, and then these files typically do not pass through any of your automated tests, or get skipped in your manual tests...which means the hidden problems get shipped to your users in production. If you are reading this right now, you have probably shipped "buggy" translation files to real users in production, am I right?

Furthermore, there are best practices we want to adhere to with our translated files, and these best practices should be enforceable with an integrity check.
